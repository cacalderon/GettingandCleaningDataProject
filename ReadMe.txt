The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. 
You will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set as described below, 
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 


Steps to reproduce this project

two files will be created at the end of the run. 
merged.txt with the merged data
